# Form Backend

This project is a serverless backend that handles form submissions for my projects.

It's built using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/), and a PostgreSQL database (powered by [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/storage/postgres)) and deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
